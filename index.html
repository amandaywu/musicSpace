                    <b>Danceability</b>
                        <p>Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical <br>
                        elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of <br>
                        0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</p><br>
                        <b>How we choose the visual encoding: </b>
                        <p>We use a jagged line to represent dancability because the edges and sharp points remind us of <br>
                        pulse and represents movement. The higher the danceability is, the more jagged the line is. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="audio_select text-center" id="energy"  style="display: block;">
                    <b>Energy</b>
                        <p>Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. <br> 
                        Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while <br>
                         a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. </p><br>
                        <b>How we choose the visual encoding: </b>
                        <p>We use transparency of the entire picture to represent energy because we think an energeteic song will <br>
                        have more presence and therefore has less transparency.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="audio_select text-center" id="acousticness"  style="display: none;">

                    <b>Acousticness</b>
                    <p>Acoustic music primarily uses instruments that produce sound through acoustic means, as opposed <br>
                     to electric or electronic means.A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. <br>
                      1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.</p><br>
                    <b>How we choose the visual encoding: </b>
                    <p>We decided to use line to represent the precense of additional track/instrument. A song with acoustic <br>
                     score close to 1.0 will have less line and vice versa. The total amount of lines to display is 10. <br>
                      (when acoustic score is from 0.0-0.1) </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="audio_select text-center" id="instrumentalness"  style="display: none;">

                    <b>Instrumentalness</b>
                        <p>Predicts whether a track contains no vocals.  Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. <br> 
                        The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal <br>
                         content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher <br>
                          as the value approaches 1.0.</p><br>
                        <b>How we choose the visual encoding: </b>
                        <p>We use the magnitude of the sun/moon to represent instrumentalness. The size of the sun represents <br> 
                            the amount of vocal content. Music with a high instrumentalness score will result in a very small sun/moon.</p>
                    </div>                                    
                    <div class="audio_select text-center" id="liveness"  style="display: none;">
                    <b>Liveness</b>
                        <p>Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased <br> 
                            probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood <br> 
                            that the track is live. </p><br>
                        <b>How we choose the visual encoding: </b>
                        <p>We use the magnitude of green mountains to represent liveness because mountains convey a sense of <br> 
                            liveliness and energy normally seen from the audience in musical performances. A high liveness score <br> 
                            will results in taller/bigger sets of mountains in the visualization.</p>
                    </div>  
                    <div class="audio_select text-center" id="speechiness"  style="display: none;">
                            <b>Speechiness</b>
                                <p>Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the <br>

                                     may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. <br> 
                                     Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.</p><br>

                                <p>The animated cloud represents the speechiness of a song. Higher speechiness score will generate more cloud, <br> 
                                    and if a speechiness score is close to 1, the visualization will be covered by cloud.   </p>

                            <b>Tempo</b>
                                <p>The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is <br> 
                                    the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration. </p><br>
                                <b>How we choose the visual encoding: </b>
                                <p>We use the wave to represent tempo because we think the movement in water can represent the speed or pace of a song.<br> 
                                If the tempo number is high, the waves will be more dense to reflect the fast pace. </p>

                    <b>Valence</b>
                        <p>A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high <br> 
                            valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more <br> 
                            negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). </p><br>
                        <b>How we choose the visual encoding: </b>
                        <p>We use the color scheme of the background to represent valence because we think color communicates mood <br> 
                        very well, and valence is a representation of the overall mood of the song. When the song has a high valence  <br>
                        score, it tends to be happier, and we increase the amount of warm tone in the color gradient, and vice versa.</p>

                        <b>Mode</b>
                        <p>Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic <br> 
                            content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.</p><br>
                        <b>How we choose the visual encoding: </b>
                        <p>We use a sun/moon to represent mode because of the melodic difference between major and minor <br> 
                            music is very different. Some describes that there is a certain sound-quality to major and<br> 
                            minor. We display the sun when the music is major and the moon when the music is minor. </p>

                                Thought I found a way<br>
                                Thought I found a way, yeah (found)<br>
                                But you never go away (never go away)<br>
                                So I guess I gotta stay now<br>
                                <br>
                                Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here<br>
                                Even if it takes all night or a hundred years<br>
                                Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near<br>
                                Wanna feel alive, outside I can fight my fear<br>
                                <br>
                                Isn't it lovely, all alone?<br>
                                Heart made of glass, my mind of stone<br>
                                Tear me to pieces, skin to bone<br>

                                I had a dream<br>
                                I got everything I wanted<br>
                                Not what you'd think<br>
                                And if I'm being honest<br>
                                It might've been a nightmare<br>
                                To anyone who might care<br>
                                <br>
                                Thought I could fly (fly)<br>
                                So I stepped off the Golden, mm<br>
                                Nobody cried (cried, cried, cried, cried)<br>
                                Nobody even noticed<br>
                                I saw them standing right there<br>
                                Kinda thought they might care (might care, might care)<br>
                                <br>
                                I had a dream<br>
                                I got everything I wanted<br>
                                But when I wake up, I see<br>
                                You with me<br>
                                <br>
                                And you say, "As long as I'm here<br>
                                No one can hurt you<br>
                                Don't wanna lie here<br>
                                But you can learn to<br>
                                If I could change<br>
                                The way that you see yourself<br>
                                You wouldn't wonder why you hear<br>
                                They don't deserve you"<br>
                                <br>
                                I tried to scream<br>
                                But my head was underwater<br>
                                They called me weak<br>
                                Like I'm not just somebody's daughter<br>
                                Coulda been a nightmare<br>
                                But it felt like they were right there<br>
                                <br>
                                And it feels like yesterday was a year ago<br>
                                But I don't wanna let anybody know<br>
                                'Cause everybody wants something from me now<br>
                                And I don't wanna let 'em down<br>
                                <br>

                                Would I do it again?<br>
                                If they knew what they said would go straight to my head<br>
