Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary

I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head

You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone

I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go

Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

Imagen perfecta, no necesitas filtro
Magnífico, hazlos caer muertos, eres una asesina
Ducharte con toda mi atención
Sí, estas son mis únicas intenciones
Quédate en la cocina cocinando, obtén tu propio pan
Corazón lleno de equidad, eres una activa
Asegúrate de no necesitar menciones
Sí, estas son mis únicas intenciones

[Verso 1: Justin Bieber]
Un agradecimiento a tu mamá y papá por hacerte
Soportando la ovación, hicieron un gran trabajo recaudando
Cuando escribo, eres mi musa
Ese tipo de sonrisa que hace las noticias
Nadie puede hablar mal de ti en estas calles
Triple amenaza, eres una jefa, eres una bebé, eres una bestia
Haces que sea fácil elegir
Tienes un toque malo, no puedo rechazarlo (No, no puedo rechazarlo)

[Coro: Justin Bieber]

Asegúrate de no necesitar menciones
Sí, estas son mis únicas intenciones

[Verso 2: Justin Bieber]
Ya aprobada, no necesita aprobación
Sé buena en todos lados, no te preocupes por no ser aceptada
Insuperable, ahora tienes la ventaja
No necesito un patrocinador, no, eres la marca ahora
Eres mi roca, mi Colorado
Tengo ese anillo, al igual que Toronto
Amarte ahora, un poco más mañana
Así es como me siento, actúa como si supieras que eres

[Verso 3: Quavo]
No miento, sin fingir, no necesitas menciones (No miento)
Tengo los mismos objetivos, no quieren ser independientes ('Pendientes)
Diles que se preocupen por tu voluntad (Wuh), nosotros en nuestros sentimientos
Es cincuenta por ciento cincuenta (Cincuenta), atención, necesitamos compromiso (Oh)
Los dos tenemos que admitirlo (Ambos)
Es divertido que ambos escuchemos (Ambos)
Es una bendición (Bendición), porque los dos lo obtenemos (Ambos)
Eres lo mejor (Wuh), y no necesito un testigo (Lo mejor)
Voy a buscarme un anillo y rezar para que quede perfecto (Perfecto, perfecto)

Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up
Speedin' fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
Now you're the one that I'm callin'
Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

They find a way to break it down
Break down
Tear me up inside
When you break me down"

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall

[Часть I]

[Припев: Drake]
Работаю на выходных, как обычно
Сторонюсь тусовок, как обычно
Ниггеры клянутся, что они превзошли нас, что они делают слишком круто
До сих пор плачу налоги за свои заскоки
Патеки от Вирджила на запястье - с ума сойти
Ниггеры спалили как я поскользнулся - что теперь?
Кто-то разнес ваш район, я бы сказал, если бы это были мы
Люкс-номер в Rosewood, слишком роскошно

[Куплет: Drake]
Говоришь мои дни сочтены, но я продолжаю просыпаться
Знаю ты видишь мои сообщения, детка, пожалуйста, ответь что-нибудь
Вино в бокале, а твой парень — крохобор, ага?
Ниггеры свалят в день моего релиза, ага
Сука, это слава, а не власть
Я даже не знаю, что это такое, следи за языком
У малышки эго в два раза больше ее кроватки
Не могу ей нагрубить, что есть, то есть (Что)
Сказал то, что должен был, и сделал то, что сделал (эй)
Никогда не поворачиваюсь спиной к FBG, боже упаси
Патеки от Вирджила крутят сальто на запястье
Даю тебе свой номер, но не вздумай беспокоить по херне

[Припев: Drake]
Работаю на выходных, как обычно
Сторонюсь тусовок, как обычно (как обычно)
Ниггеры клянутся, что они превзошли нас, что они делают слишком круто
До сих пор плачу налоги за свои заскоки
Патеки от Вирджила на запястье - с ума сойти
Ниггеры спалили как я поскользнулся - что теперь?
Кто-то разнес ваш район, я бы сказал, если бы это были мы

[Часть II]

[Припев: Future]
Да, сотня тысяч за самое дешевое кольцо на пальце ниггера, сучка, у
Слетал до Испании посмотреть владения, одел суку в Audemars, у
Скинул пару баксов на кольцо, стоит словно Бентли грузовик, сучка, у
Я был на притоне и толкал кокс, с тех пор я уже не тот, у

[Куплет 1: Future]
Бабуля, она стояла прямо там, пока я играл в свой конструктор, у
Я вывожу из строя мелких ниггеров, Талибан в этой сучке, у
Мне было плохо в их окопах, приходилось ездить с этой палкой, у
Кто дал тебе таблетки? Кто дал тебе пыль? Pluto посылал тебя прилизаться, у
Слишком много осужденных колесят со мной, чтобы играть в твои игры, у
Не выношу херни, расстрелял суку, как Усаму, у
Теперь они поджигают свечки, нигга, любой может оказаться на его месте, у
Я на частном самолете поджигаю блант, Backwood полный дури, у
Пытаюсь провезти в Лондон Калаш с увеличенным, у
Они должны отпустить ниггу или мы сдохнем за него, у
Да, я езжу за своими ниггерами, я лгу своей сучке, у
Бедные ниггеры, теперь богатые ниггеры, мы сделали это, е
Я был в петле, щас пентхаус для шкафа, у
Как будто люстра на шее и на запястье, у
Мои белые девки говорят на разных языках, у
Прометазин в моем теле, так же как Перкосет, е

[Припев: Future]
Сотня тысяч за самое дешевое кольцо на пальце ниггера, сучка, у
Слетал до Испании посмотреть владения, одел суку в Audemars, у
Скинул три бакса на кольцо, стоит словно Бентли грузовик, сучка, у
Я был на притоне и толкал кокс, с тех пор я уже не тот, у

[Куплет 2: Future]
Тонны налички, я звоню Серене
Я направляюсь в Tremendo за феттуччине
Но все это факт, [карат с мизинец]
Но все это факт, мы заказали Fiji
Я зачастил с этим ""у"", я зачастил с ухаживаниями, что предпочтешь?
Я покажу твою физиономию в новостях, а пизду - на футболке после того, как замажу
А потом заставлю их подстрелить катафалк, это обойдется мне в четверть доллара, ниггер, оно того стоит
А ты маньяк, ебанный инопланетянин, как ты расплачиваешься?
У меня есть кошечка, я с ней развлекаюсь, идем в Birkin

[Припев: Future]
Да, сотня тысяч за самое дешевое кольцо на пальце ниггера, сучка, у

I swear this industry shit, to me, is one big-ass lick
I walk inside of a buildin', tell the A&R nigga ""strip""
Tell 'em I need all of my chips, my life been on Section 8
I've been a welfare case, AFDC pump fake
Meanwhile, I'm grindin' 'cause drug money ain't like rap money
Four white kilo, snow-bunny, equal one whole show, dummy
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up
I got a bad call, they killed Braze
They killed Chad, my big homie Pup
Puppy eyes on my face, bruh
And I really be drinkin', why the fuck I really been smokin'?
What the fuck? I'm the sober one
Man, I'm so stressed out, I can't focus
Hide out when I ride out, ski mask with the eyes out
Speed past in the Cutlass, me and little Ocho
Every young nigga hop out
Two tears in a bucket, I feel like ""fuck it""
The price of fame, recognize my pain, it's all I know
All out war but I'm out here though
Call my troops like, ""vamonos""
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up
I got a bad call, and it's all bad
Off a OG with my OG and some OE by the tall glass

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
You can't expect the unexpected, these dreams are manifested
From my head into reality, they seems a bit excessive
But I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings
All the times that I've been reckless with an ego big as Texas
Thinkin' ""I'm the man"", I never let these hoes inside the plan
My room for bullshit in the crib as small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk a path where only giants stand
I am the fire man, shit I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone, on the road
Even though I know they need me at home
Keep my control from a city where it's freezin' and cold
Each to their own, punches like this probably beat up Stallone

Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka

Wow, niggas been crampin' my style
Blowin' my high, they want a reply
The number one question is, ""How?""
How does it feel now that you on?
How much you worth? How big is your home?
How come you won't get a few features?
I think you should? How 'bout I don't?
How 'bout you just get the fuck off my dick?
How 'bout you listen and never forget?
Only gon' say this one time, then I'll dip
Niggas ain't worthy to be on my shit
Haven't you heard? I'm as cold as the tip
Tip of the iceberg that tipped the Titanic
No tip-toein' around it, my shit is gigantic
As big as the fuckin' Atlantic, I'm lit, bitch

[Verse 6: Joyner Lucas]
Niggas want war, but it ain't likely
Boy, you know, threats I don't take lightly
Better have hands if you gon' fight me
Got a quick left jab and that shit's light-speed
Niggas say I'm next up and I just might be
Started from the bottom they ain't know a lot about him
All I had was Ramen noodles and a little iced tea
Now my life's like a movie, motherfuckin' Spike Lee
I just want canaries on my wristwatch, yeah
Niggas get buried in the slipknot, woah
Shorty think I'm married, but my dick's not, uh
I ain't get married 'til my dick drop, yeah
I just wanna hit it in some flip flops, woah
I don't want kids, I don't lip-lock, no

Once you makin' provolone, they think you sellin' from your home
Motherfuck these maricóns, excuse me, I'm not bashin' shit
I open safes like open sesame now there ain't no cash in it
Crash the whip like I'm Crash Bandicoot then get my bands a coupe
Bands are blue from what they hand to you, my guap is tangible
Sayin' to you, ""My shit's phenomenal, I'm a phenomenon""
Back in the days, my boys was starvin' and it wasn't Ramadan
Octagon, if it's about my feet then the boy get dropped
If it's paper over pussy, best believe everything gon' pop
When I walk into the building now, it's open the close-up shop
When I— (Monster, You get in my way, I'ma )
Ashley Banks, Carlton Banks, Hilary Banks robbin' a bank
Outta your league, outta your rank, wanna be us but niggas can't

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm fittin' to kill 'em and dumpin' their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
Or be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blown up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—

Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

And we're going 'round and 'round, playing silly games
Now you're saying, slow it down, not right now
Then ya wink at me and walk away
Let  it be, let it be, let it be known
Hold on, don't go
Touching and teasing me, telling me no
But this time I need to feel you

[Chorus]
Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you

[Verse 2]
Movida was the club on the Saturday
Ya actin' like a diva, sayin' you don't wanna pay
It's gotta be ya feisty style, raised eyebrow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in, you order a mojito at the bar
You re-apply lippy 'cause it came off on the glass
The DJ plays your favorite songs, Kanye's on
Now ya beckoning for me to dance
Mm, pullin' me, pullin' me, pullin' me close
Just close your eyes, girl
Whispering, tellin' me we gotta go
Won't you take me home? I want to ride it

[Chorus]
Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Won't you take me home? I wanna
Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride it, let me feel you"

I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

[Pre-Chorus: JP Saxe]
I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

[Chorus: JP Saxe]
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]
I tried to imagine your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

[Pre-Chorus: JP Saxe & Julia Michaels]
And I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
Sky'd be falling while I hold you tight
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over, right?
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?

I know, you know, we know you weren't

Thought I almost died in my dream again (Baby, almost died)
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep (Oh, oh)
Without you, I can't sleep (Fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe

[Verse 2]
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart

[Verse 3]
Never comin' down, uh
I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah

[Bridge]
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home

[Chorus]
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go

Kétezer éve születtem, azóta vártam a jelet egy erdőben

Ki kéne adnom egy szótárat mert ha koncentráltok sem értetek
Purple kész van a cigivel, két és fél perc múlva feléledek
A szél oda fújta a füstöt, beszélni se tudtok annyira betéptetek

Apokaliptikus a jövőkép de én be vagyok tárazva mindennel
Ötven milliárd kiadatlan számommal tele egy winchester
Durran a pezsgő, durrog a tüzijáték pedig nincs is szilveszter
Lassú Isten 140-el kanyarodik és nem is indexel
Fék nélkül vesszük be a kanyart, mi nyomot hagyunk az úttesten
Lefújja a szél a kalapomat, [?] a zsebemben, magamat túlettem
A szemem vérben forog, azthiszitek hogy az ördög megbújt bennem

Olyan oldalát vágom, hidd csak el jobb is neked ha nem ismered
Mindenedet a hypeért, már [?] nem is mered
Mindent elbír a papír de nincs semmi, akkor meg mit flexelsz?

You can suck my dick and lick a nut too (Woo)
Yeah, you don't like me, nigga, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you

Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down

[Verse 1: NLE Choppa]
Walk down on 'em in Balenciaga runners
My blood slime a nigga out just like an anaconda
You go against me, then you fucked just like a used condom (You fucked, yeah)
I roll 'em up and then I smoke 'em like some good ganja, ayy (I smoke 'em up, yeah)
Still doing drive-bys, but I wanna walk 'em (I wanna)
If I can't find 'em, you know I'm gonna stalk 'em (I gotta stalk 'em)
Caution tape up on the scene, I had to white chalk 'em (Grrt, grrt)
Running from my gun, but my bullets had to hawk 'em (Yeah)

[Chorus: NLE Choppa]
Uh, posted (Posted), in front of the trap (Front the trap)
Selling dope 'til the sun come down (Come down)
Take a fuck nigga right off the map (Off the map)
When I hit him with this whole hundred rounds (A hundred rounds)
Yung Joc, in the club with my Glock (With my Glock)
You want to play, and then this bitch going down (It's goin' down)
We ain't hesitatin', bullets get to blazin' (Get to blazin')
I'ma lay him down like he in the lounge
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
Nigga, I was posted on the corner where the J's at
Roll up in the four by four, pull up at the corner store
And I got red in my drink when I pour up soda
I remember prayin' that the feds never take the Motorola
Choppa got the chopper, make 'em do a backflip
Pay my dawg a dime to walk him down, he need the racks, bitch
I been drinkin', I been taking all this codeine to the face
Got a lot of M's in the safe
Caught a murder, then I beat the case
I was just about to do the race

[Chorus: NLE Choppa]
Uh, posted (Posted), in front of the trap (Front the trap)
Selling dope 'til the sun come down (Come down)
Take a fuck nigga right off the map (Off the map)
When I hit him with this whole hundred rounds (A hundred rounds)

You want to play, and then this bitch going down (It's goin' down)
We ain't hesitatin', bullets get to blazin' (Get to blazin')
I'ma lay him down like he in the lounge
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down"

You did read it, and it will happen. Post Malone has recently joined the exclusive list of artists to perform on Virtual Reality. The concert, scheduled for 17 of October will take place on the Raleigh’s PNC Arena, and streamed through the Oculus Venue app. So everyone who owns an Oculus headset will be able to watch the concert on a 180 perspective through Oculus Venues.

Post Malone is ready to “Bend Minds”, according to Billboard, and they are not wrong, the concert is going to be one of the increasing amounts of events to be streamed on VR this year, through the Oculus Venue app.

The Raleigh’s PNC Arena, in North Carolina, will hold the event that will be streamed in a 180 degrees perspective through Oculus Venue, an app of the VR company to watch exclusive events through Oculus devices.

The Grammy-winning artist dropped his most recent album, Hollywood’s Bleeding, back in September with some great collaborators, such as Ozzy Osborne and Travis Scott in the track “Take What You Want”, and Halsey alongside Future for “Die For Me”. The record also includes the singles “Wow” and “Sunflower” (Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse) featuring Swae Lee, both reaching the top 10 of the Global Chart on Spotify.

Malone talked about the concert and according to Variety stated that “When putting together this tour, I wanted to make sure I was giving my fans something new and crazy with this new production and show.“ Later adding that “Working with Oculus on this VR broadcast gives fans at home a chance to sit front row with me during my North Carolina show, just like you’re in the arena. That sounds pretty f***ing cool to me.”

PREVIOUS CONCERTS BROADCASTED ON VR
The concert will make Austin Richard Post Aka Post Malone, one of the few people to have done this kind of show. Still, among important artists who have done it before there are Billie Eilish, who did it a month ago, and Tenacious D.

Tenacious D went out to do it on July 31st and many agree saying that it was a success and that the experience actually made it more comfortable. An unexpected advantage of “different state legislation” for some people, as it is mentioned in this article from The Cult Machine.
Moving a little closer on time, on September 3rd, we were able to see Billie Eilish’s concert being streamed on VR, using Oculus Venues as the platform as well. Eilish played in Madrid, Spain, and according to many articles, the experience and opinions may vary a lot, as it is explained in this article from the UploadVR.

According to iHeartRadio, she talked about the concert stating that ""I make everybody get really low, and we all jump when the drop comes in. Even though you'll be watching on a VR headset, you should still get low and jump with everyone.""

Besides music, there’s a lot of exclusive events that plan on going towards Virtual Reality, including the NBA. Last September they announced their collaboration with many VR platform to broadcast about 26 games starting this October. It is likely that soon you can watch the NFL season and bet on the Superbowl favorites, using VR technology.

VR HAS TAKEN OVER THE LAST YEAR
Although the recent concerts of some of the biggest stars of the moment have made VR reach a spotlight, there are a couple of extra apps that have taken a step forward on this remark. They are having thesigning deals with some of the biggest record labels and allowing us to feel we are on the crowds of different concerts, events or even festivals.

It is safe to say that Virtual Reality keeps breaking walls but is also worth to think for a minute how this could affect the trends, the attendances to concerts and many other factors. Also, what could change into the VR Apps for this kind of shows, if microtransactions are a possibility or any possible alteration in the near future."

Call me what you wanna, I'll be what you wanna
I've been here a thousand times, eh-eh
Fallin' for another, I don't even bother
I could do it all my life

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me if you wanna 'cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it 'cause I can't believe it
With every touch of you, it's like I've started dreaming
Guess heaven's not that far away

You know that I can't get you out of my system

You can do whatever, I'll be here forever
Spinning 'round inside this room, eh-eh
Won't you come on over? I'm a sucker for ya
Wishing we'll be out here soon

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me if you wanna 'cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it 'cause I can't believe it
With every touch of you, it's like I've started dreaming

Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down

Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause know I've had enough of them

I'm gonna start this out by saying (By saying)
I really meant well from the start
Take a broken man right in my hands

Every day leg day, she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid

This that hot girl bummer two-step
They can't box me in, I'm too left

They can't fit me in a Trojan
Out of pocket, but I'm always in my bag
Yeah, that's the slogan
This that, ""Who's all there?""
I'm pullin' up wit' a emo chick that's broken

[Śmiech, krzyk]

[Refren: Camila Cabello]
Mówią, że on lubi dobry czas (Mój, och, mój)
On ożywa północą (Każdą nocą)
Moja mama mu nie ufa (Mój, och, mój)
Jest on tylko tutaj po jedną rzecz, ale (Ja też)

[Zwrotka 1: Camila Cabello]
(Tak) Był troszeczkę starszy (Hmm)
Miał czarną, skórzaną ramoneskę (Hej)
Złą reputację, nienasycone zwyczaje
Był on mną zauroczony, jedno spojrzenie i nie mogłam oddychać, tak
Powiedział, że jeśli mnie pocałuje, mogłabym na to pozwolić (Och-o-och)

[Pre-Refren: Camila Cabello]
Przysięgam za me życie, że byłam miłą dziewczyną (Och-o-och)
Dzisiaj wieczorem nie chcę być nią

[Refren: Camila Cabello i DaBaby]
Mówią, że on lubi dobry czas (Mój, och, mój)
On ożywa północą (Każdą nocą)
Moja mama mu nie ufa (Mój, och, mój)
Jest on tylko tutaj po jedną rzecz, ale (Lecimy) (Ja też) (Popatrz)

[Zwrotka 2: DaBaby i Camila Cabello]
Jestem tym typem, który może ją uwieść dla tatusia (Och, tak)
DaBaby sprawi, że zapomni, czego się nauczyła od swojego tatusia [Śmiech]
Nie chcę się mylić dla maleńkiej panienki, pozwalam jej robić to, co ona pragnie
Nie chcę całować tej małej panienki, zarówno ona nie chce mnie całować
Przyszła z Tobą, a potem wyszła ze mną
Miałem punkt zwrotny, możemy go nawet nazwać (Tak, tak)
Nie lubię bryki, w której ona jest, skończę na kupnie nowego Bimmera (Lecimy)
Ta dziewczyna wie, czego ona chce, sprawia, że chcę się rozebrać, kiedy mnie widzi (Lecimy)
Mówi, że sprawiam, że staje się mokra, kiedy tylko ma twarzyczka wyskoczy na wizji
Musiałem powiedzieć, ""Z brakiem nieuszanowania, muszę to zrobić bezpiecznie, albo możesz to zostawić""
Gwiazda popu, wyszedłem świeży z trapu i zamieniam się w Biebera
Wie, że oddzwaniam, może dać mi przypinkę, a ja mógłbym ją odwiedzić
Stań obok mnie, skończysz na złapaniu gorączki (Tak, tak)
Jestem gorący (Och-o-och) (Ta-tak)

[Pre-Refren: Camila Cabello]
Przysięgam za me życie, że byłam miłą dziewczyną
(Dobrą dziewczyną, dobrą dziewczyną)
Dzisiaj wieczorem nie chcę być nią

[Refren: Camila Cabello]
Mówią, że on lubi dobry czas (Mój, och, mój)
On ożywa północą (Każdą nocą)
(On ożywa, och, każdą nocą)
Moja mama mu nie ufa (Mój, och, mój)
Jest on tylko tutaj po jedną rzecz, ale (Ja też)

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
Mój, mój, mój, mój, mój, och, mój
Moja mama Ci nie ufa, kochanie
Mój, mój, mój, mój, mój, och, mój
I mój tata Ciebie nie zna, nie

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you

And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh

Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

And it's not about you, oh-oh
Oh-oh, I've been breaking hearts too
And I learned it all from you, oh-oh

That's when you want all in, but I'm not your woman
When my lipstick pops and I feel like Monroe
That's when you want me most, oh-oh

I'm all out of salt, I'm not gonna cry
Won't give you what you want
'Cause I look way too good tonight
I'm all out of salt, tears are running dry

Push my head into the cake, no more
Oh-oh, you're the snake pulling my arm
Like my snakeskin Saint Laurent, oh-oh

He keeps leaving you for dead
I don't know what you been waiting for
So you've got your love locked up instead
But somethin' better's waitin' at your door

You don't know your worth
All the things I know that you deserve
Say it's not real if it doesn't hurt
Find someone you know will put you first
Find someone who loves you at your worst

Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up

Find someone who loves you at your worst

Don't forget the words I said
Picking you up when you're feelin' down
You get strung on thoughts left in your head
When you lose hope, soon you will be found

We are, we are, we are
ما هستیم، هستیم، هستیم ...
[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
توی لس آنجلس و شب شنبه چله ی تابستون
Sundown and they all come out
خورشید غروب میکنه و همه میریزن بیرون
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
با لامبورگینی ها و هامر های اجاره شدشون
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
پارتی شروع میشه، پس اونا دارن میان سمت مرکز شهر (دور و بر اینجا)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
همه دنبال اینن که سریعتر آماده بشن و برسن به پارتی (ایهام، همه دنبال طلوع و روشنایی خورشید میگردن)
And they wanna know what you're about
و اونا میخوان بدونن که نظر تو چیه
Me in the middle with the one I love and
من و کسی که دوسش دارم وسطای راهیم و ...
We're just tryna figure everything out
فقط داریم تلاش میکنیم که از همه چی سر در بیاریم

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
خوب با همدیگه کنار نمیایم چونکه ما فقط خودمونیم
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
میتونستم یه ذره کمگ بگیرم که از این بحث و جدل بکشیم بیرون، آره
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
خیلی خوشگل شدی(به نظر میای)، عزیزم، پس دیگه اون سوالو اینجا نپرس
This is my only fear: that we become
تنها ترسم اینه که: بشیم مثل ....

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Beautiful people
آدمای خوشگل
Drop top, designer clothes
با ماشینای بدون سقفشون، و لباسای مارک دارشون
Front row at fashion shows
توی ردیف جلویی نمایش مد (فشن شو) میشینن
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
چی کار میکنی؟ و چی میدونی؟
Inside the world of beautiful people
توی دنیای آدمای خوشگل
Champagne and rolled-up notes
شامپاین میزنیم و پولای رول شده رو آماده میکنیم
Prenups and broken homes
توافقای قبل از ازدواج و زوج هایی که از همدیگه طلاق گرفتن
Surrounded, but still alone
کلی آدم دور و برمونه، اما هنوزم تنهایییم
Let's leave the party
بیا این پارتی رو ول کنیم بریم

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
این رفتار اون کسی که هستیم نیستش (ما هستیم، هستیم، هستیم)
We are not beautiful
ما خوشگل (پولدار) نیستیم
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
اره، این رفتار اون کسی که هستیم نیستش (ما هستیم، هستیم، هستیم)
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)
ما خوشگل (پولدار) نیستیم (خوشگل)

[Verse 2: Khalid]
L.A., mmm, drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
توی لس آنجلس، ممم، برای چند ساعت آخر شب رانندگی کردیم و به هیچ جا نرسیدیم (هیچ جا، هیچ جا)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
ستاره هارو توی چشمات میبینم وقتی نصف راهو تا اونجا میریم (تموم شب)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
من با همه ی چراغاشون و فلش دوربیناشون به هم ریخته نمیشم (حواسم از تو پرت نمیشه)
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
چونکه با دستایی که تورو بغل کردن، دیگه نیازی به اهمیت دادن به اونا ندارم

We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
خوب با همدیگه کنار نمیایم چونکه ما فقط خودمونیم

Woo, damn
I ain't been broke in a minute, don't get offended
Tore off the bow in a Bentley, fucking your ho in her kidney
Fuck up the city, I do not dance, I jiggy
Gun is tucked under this Fendi
I like it, I spend it, I just came right out the jeweller
The ice on my neck, and my wrist, and my fist, I ain't finished
I was just workin' at Denny's, came back and counted some millions
I ain't no regular civillian
Red, yellow, green, look like my neck a chameleon
Ugh, okay, spin it, ugh
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I hit his bitch, he offended
I'm in Givenchy and Fendi
They let me finish
I cut that Chevy for four day
My scammer bussing bottles off the '08
I cannot cuff, she fucking on my brozay
I'm just gon' fuck her, treat her like a throwaway
Ooh, damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I'm at the mall out in Venice
I need it, swiping the digits
Calling up Kelz, he did 250 on biddie
It ain't no biggie, uh
Moncler, kick it
Fucked that lil' bih, made a viddie
She wanna leak it
She wanna send it
Ayy, fuck that bitch, my face wasn't in it
Damn, bitch do scams on bitty
Bands in my hands look pretty
Hit another band on the 'gram, I'm litty
When I was broke, man, she fronted, but then I got rich and I hit it
Homie, I don't dance, I jiggy
Weed is so strong, I feel like I'm Popeye off the spinach
I cut the corner and bend it
Bitch, I'm a menace like Dennis
Don't sell me pussy, I need a percentage
If you gon' fuck me, this shit is expensive
Nordstrom Rack, swipe my gift

[Intro: Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
Tú no ere' una santa, ni yo soy un santo
Nos conocimo' pecando
Ahora me está' buscando
Porque quiere más de mí (¡Bad!)
Y yo te lo doy (¡Bunny!)
Te viene' y me voy (DY)
Te lo dije que esto era pa' jugar
Que no te podía' enamorar (¡Sube, sube, plo!)

[Coro: Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
Que ahora me quiere' cambiar
Sabiendo cómo soy, tú sabe' lo que doy
No te haga', tú ere' igual (¿Qué, qué, qué?)
No te haga' la santa, el perreo te encanta (You know)
Y ahora me quiere' cambiar (Yeah-yeah, eh)
Sabiendo cómo soy, tú sabe' lo que doy
No te haga', tú ere' igual (Tú ere' igual, bebé)
No te haga' la santa, el perreo te encanta (¡Da-ddy!)

[Verso 1: Daddy Yankee]
Mami, somo' polo positivo y negativo (¿Qué?)
A la flecha de Cupido siempre me le esquivo (Cucú)
Tenemo' secreto' guarda'o en el archivo
No va a haber confianza si contigo convivo, baby
'Tás calentándote (Wow), yo calentándome (Eh)
Y tú dice' que tú ere' brava, pero a vece' te me quita (Rrr)
Y vuelve' y me excita'
Pero yo no soy el hombre que necesita' (Yeh)

[Pre-Coro: Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
Yo no voy con labia, no
Tú sabía' la que había, baby
El romance no e' mi área, no (¿Qué?)
No me diga' que te enamoraste de mí
Yo no voy con labia, no
Tú sabía' (Tú sabía'), la que había, baby (Baby)
El romance no e' mi área, no
No me diga' (No me diga'), que te enamoraste de mí (Mí)

[Coro: Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
Y ahora me quiere' cambiar (Sube)
Sabiendo cómo soy, tú sabe' lo que doy
No te haga', tú ere' igual (Tú ere' igual, bebé)
No te haga' la santa, el perreo te encanta
Y ahora me quiere' cambiar (Me quiere' cambiar)
Sabiendo cómo soy, tú sabe' lo que doy
No te haga', tú ere' igual (Trr)
No te haga' la santa, el perreo te encanta (Bad Bunny, come on)

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
No me diga' que me quiere', no me diga' que me ama'
Tú sabe' que no te creo
Mucho meno' en tu cama
Seguimo' envuelto' en la bellaquera, ey
Ey, la noche entera
Eso de enamorarse no e' pa' cualquiera
Dejé el corazón dentro 'e la nevera
Lo tengo frío, frío, sorry, pero en nadie confío
Tú sigue en lo tuyo y yo en lo mío
Buena' noche', fue un placer, ey
Pero no me va' a convencer (Come, on)

[Pre-Coro: Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
Yo no voy con labia, no
Tú sabía' la que había, baby
El romance no e' mi área, no
No me diga' que te enamoraste de mí
Yo no voy con labia, no
Tú sabía' (Tú sabía'), la que había, baby (Eh-eh)
El romance no e' mi área, no
No me diga' (No me diga'), que te enamoraste de mí (¿Qué?)

Y ahora me quieres cambiar
Sabiendo cómo soy, tú sabe' lo que doy
No te haga', tú ere' igual (Tú ere' igual, bebé)
No te haga' la santa, el perreo te encanta
Y ahora me quiere' cambiar
Sabiendo cómo soy, tú sabe' lo que doy (Yo')
No te haga', tú ere' igual
No te haga' la santa, el perreo te encanta, eh

So I never really knew you
God, I really tried to
Blindsided, addicted
Thought we could really do this
But really I was foolish
Hindsight, it's obvious

[Pre-Chorus]
Talking with my lawyer
She said, ""Where’d you find this guy?""
I said, ""Young people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes""

[Chorus]
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you’re in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny how a memory
Turns into a bad dream
When running wild turns volatile
Remember how we painted our house
Just like my grandparents did
So romantic, but we fought the whole time
Should've seen the signs, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Talking with my mother
She said, ""Where’d you find this guy?""
Said, ""Some people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes""

[Chorus]
Some mistakes get made
That’s alright, that's okay
You can think that you’re in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made

(Oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Bridge]
They say it's better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all
That could be a load of shit
But I just need to tell you all

[Chorus]
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just engaged
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe

Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

Once we've both said our goodbyes

One shot is never enough
I just wait for us to go in circles
A lifetime of giving my all for you
(Hostile, give me a break

And first, he would tell me I'm his friend
Actually, no thanks, I'm okay
And then he would send weird looks my way

I want new friends, but they don't want me
They're making plans while I watch TV
Thought it was them, but maybe it's me
I want new friends, but they don't want me

When they said, ""This is the beginning of the best years""

And the distance from my room, is anything so necessary?
I was thinking about that thing that you said last night, so boring

And the '80s bands? Oh, where did they go?
Can we switch into the chorus right now?

I want new friends, but they don't want me
They have some fun, but then they just leave
Is it just them? Or maybe all me?
Why my new friends don't seem to want me

Hurts my case, but that's okay
It hurts my case, but that's okay
We're dancing on a moonbeam
On and on and on and on and on

Your love is suicidal
Lately I've been feeling suicidal
Your love is suicidal

I thought that we were meant to be
You took my heart and made it bleed
I gave you all my ecstasy
I know you'll be the death of me (Keep it Z3N)

Sippin' on this Hennessy, once you were my friend
Now you turned into my enemy, here we go again
I think love is just like money how it blows in the wind
Got me taking medicine, these is not no vitamins
I thought that we were meant to be
'Til you struck out like one, two, three
The thought of you was heavenly
At first, now it's where Hell will be
Oh, I've been balling on my own, shawty, sipping fours
Pour it in a twenty, make it strong, shawty, gripping poles
Catch your new lil' nigga and it's on, shawty, I'ma blow
Hit him with the Ruger and it's too silent, make it go (Shh)
Do him bogus, make his heart hurt, that's what love is
You're leaving me for him, are you on drugs, bitch?
I know you are, 'cause you're never Perc'-less, so perfect

Hearing whispers in the night
Voices filling up your mind
You're like a ghost of you
You've been drowning in the rain
Slowly saving up the pain
So deep inside of you

See the colors of the sky
Slowly turn from black and white
A rising hope, bright as gold
Now there's nothing left to lose
So we're breaking all the rules
And they don't know what we know

'Cause I can hear
The thunder from afar
A lightning in the dark
I can feel a fire come alive
So calm before the storm
So dark before the dawn

Once you felt that burning flame
You're chasing stars alive
What was broken's left behind
Watch it crumble in the light
Nothing can stop you now

[Part 1]
Rote Lippen wie ein Rosengarten
Spiegeln sich im Ziffernblatt der Chronographen
Zwischen Drogen, Hochhäusern und Modemarken
Verbrenn' mein'n G-Wagon, es war kein Motorschaden
Deine Augenfarbe grün, meine braun
Ja, du weißt, dass ich lüg', doch du musst mir vertrau'n
Ich bin sehr verletzlich, dein Herz zerbrechlich
Unser Blut auf dem Perserteppich
Gib ihn'n Kickdown, ich halt' an der Shell
Baby, Baby
Sie sagt: „Habibi, du fährst zu schnell!“
Baby, Baby
Ich würd dich nie verlassen, nicht für zehn Mio (Tfuh)
Die Augen lügen nie, Chico
Da liegt Weiß schon wieder, ich zieh' Lines schon wieder
Und du weinst schon wieder, rrah

[Hook]
Ich hab' dir versprochen, dass ich nie mehr zieh'
Baby, Baby
Doch du siehst, ich bin wieder nicht clean
Baby, Baby
Du hast es nicht verdient, du sagst, dass du mich hasst
Doch ich weiß, dass du mich liebst, Baby
Du hast es nicht verdient
Doch ich weiß, dass du mich liebst, Baby

[Part 2]
Es ist kalt draußen, jeden Tag verbrenn' ich Zweitausend
Doch ich kann uns keine Zeit kaufen
Ich wusste immer schon, dass ich dich wieder treffe
Deine erste Frage: „​Baby, hast du eine Zigarette?“
Wir sind Lil' Kim und B.I.G.​
Hör'n „​95 BPM“ im SUV
Ich war nicht immer treu, hab' dich oft verletzt
Doch dein ganzen Körper voll Diamanten besetzt
Baby, komm, wir fliegen nach Kolumbien
Und wir zieh'n Kokaina
Und wenn ich wieder unten bin
Baby, ja, dann werd' ich wieder Dealer
Ich hab' Angst, dich zu verlier'n, Bitches, die mich markier'n
Komm' besoffen aus der Bar, stink' nach Wein, Rauch und Bier
Und immer, wenn ich auf Taş war
Hab' ich dir gesagt: „​Mann, dein Ex ist der allergrößte Bastard!“

[Hook]
Ich hab' dir versprochen, dass ich nie mehr zieh'
Baby, Baby
Doch du siehst, ich bin wieder nicht clean
Baby, Baby
Du hast es nicht verdient, du sagst, dass du mich hasst
Doch ich weiß, dass du mich liebst, Baby
Du hast es nicht verdient
Doch ich weiß, dass du mich liebst, Baby

They've been sayin' you're sophisticated
They're complainin', overeducated
You are saying all the words I'm dreaming
Say it after me
Say it after me
They will blame us, crucify and shame us
We can't help it if we are a problem
We are tryin' hard to get your attention
I'm climbin' up your wall
Climbin' up your wall

[Chorus]
Don't go there 'cause you'll never return
I know you think of me when you think of her
But then it don't make sense when you're trying hard
To do the right thing, but without recompense
And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
And now you don't know how you could ever complain
Because you're all confused 'cause you want me to
But then you want me to do it the same as you

And now you don't know how you could ever complain
Because you're all confused 'cause you want me to
But then you want me to do it the same way as you, and but

Taking my sulkin' to the masses

Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
